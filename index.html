		<b>DO NOT GO DIRECTLY TO THE HOSPITAL IF YOU THINK YOU ARE INFECTED, AS YOU MIGHT INFECT THOSE AROUND YOU</b>
		<p></p>
		<p>- If you have been in contact with someone with coronavirus or have returned from an affected area identified by the Government as high risk and you are feeling unwell with a cough, difficulty breathing or fever, stay at home and use the online coronavirus services or call the emergency number.</p>

		<p>- Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds using soap and hot water, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose, or after being in public areas where other people are doing so. Use hand sanitiser if that is all you have access to.</p>

		<p>- To reduce the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you do not have a tissue, and throw the tissue away immediately. Then wash your hands or use a hand sanitising gel.</p>

		<p>- Clean and disinfect regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.</p>

		<p>- Avoid contact with anyone who has a fever, dry cough or other symptoms. Avoid unnecessary contact with high touch areas such as handrails, lift buttons, door handles, surfaces, etc., at venues</p>
